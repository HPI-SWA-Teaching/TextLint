TextLint
===================
The Original Work on TextLint was done by Fabrizio Perin, Lukas Renggli, and Jorge Ressia. You should use the code from this repository in a copy of the TextLint distribution that can be downloaded from the "Getting started" section on their [project page](http://scg.unibe.ch/research/textlint).
